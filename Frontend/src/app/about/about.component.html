      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2024, Hildesheim Geschmack was born out of a passion for the rich food culture in Hildesheim. 
        We noticed that despite the wide variety of excellent restaurants in our city, residents and tourists 
        often struggled to find the perfect dining spot for their needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with just a handful of restaurant partners, we've grown to become the most comprehensive restaurant 
        finder platform in Hildesheim, featuring everything from traditional German cuisine to international flavors.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Our platform allows users to discover restaurants based on location, cuisine type, price range, and special 
        features. Anyone can browse our listings as a guest, but registered users enjoy personalized recommendations, 
        the ability to save favorites, and exclusive promotions from partner restaurants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Restaurant owners can register their establishments to gain visibility, manage their profiles, and connect 
        directly with potential customers.
